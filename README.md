2. Pasting the Link

	Input the URL: Copy the URL of the chosen website and paste it into your web analyzing tool or debugging platform.

3. Processing the Website

	Data Collection: The tool gathers data from the website, including HTML structure, CSS styles, JavaScript functionality, images, and other content.

Analysis and Debugging:

	SEO Analysis: The tool checks for SEO metrics such as meta tags, keywords, and content quality.

	Performance Analysis: It evaluates the page load speed, identifies large files, and checks for optimized images and scripts.

	Code Validation: The tool scans the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for errors or warnings.

	Accessibility Check: It ensures the website meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities.

	Security Analysis: The tool checks for common security vulnerabilities, such as outdated libraries or weak passwords.

4. Debugging the Web Page

	Fixing Errors: You review the highlighted issues and make necessary corrections in the code or content. This might involve editing HTML tags, optimizing images, refining CSS styles, or updating JavaScript functions.

5. Generating Audio for Findings
